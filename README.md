# **Futbol**


## **About**
> We are a four person group collaborating on the Futbol project in Mod1 at Turing.
> The collaborators are Hannah Warren, Sam Ivari, Croix Kimmel and Dylan Harper.
> In the Futbol project, we are given sports data contained in CSV files.
> With this CSV data, we used Object-Oriented Programming to determine Game, Team, Season and League statistics.

## **Built With**
> We used the following tools for this project:
* Ruby (v. 2.7.2)
* SimpleCov (https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov)

## **Testing**
> We used Rspec and Test-Driven Development to create methods that analyze certain statistics.
> We used the futbol_spec_harness provided by Turing to assess project completion.
> 
> spec_harness : https://github.com/turingschool-examples/futbol_spec_harness
